Final Project Proposal

My final project is going to be my own website. Copyright Kristen L. Johnson, to be used in my professional career and link to all my social media, linkedIn, etc.
It will consist of a homepage with a Header and a img as the background and my name, and also have a menu bar with, about me, resume type tab, skills tab, contact me, maybe even add socia media buttons that link to my pages.
So, there are going to be at least 4 tabs that link to those pages which will have drop down menus, lists, images, links, buttons, contact email form, and other things we've learned in class.
